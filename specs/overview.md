# Phase II: Full-Stack Todo Web Application Overview

## Scope and Goals

This phase transforms the existing console-based todo application into a full-stack web application with multi-user support and persistent storage. The primary objectives are:

- Migrate from console interface to modern web interface
- Implement multi-user functionality with secure authentication
- Establish persistent data storage with user-specific task isolation
- Provide responsive UI that works across all device types

## Transition from Console App to Web App

The transition involves:

- Converting command-line interactions to web-based UI interactions
- Implementing server-side processing with a web API
- Replacing local file storage with database persistence
- Adding authentication and user session management
- Providing rich, interactive user experiences via web browser

## Multi-User Support with Persistence

The application will support multiple concurrent users, each with their own isolated task data. Features include:

- Individual user accounts with secure authentication
- User-specific task ownership and isolation
- Persistent storage that maintains data between sessions
- Concurrent access by multiple users without data interference
- Secure data access controls preventing unauthorized data access
