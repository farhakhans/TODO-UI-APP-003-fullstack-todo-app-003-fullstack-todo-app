Created comprehensive task breakdown for Phase II: Full-Stack Todo Web Application with 69 individual tasks organized across 7 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks) - Project initialization and basic structure
2. Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks) - Core infrastructure that blocks all user stories
3. Phase 3: Task Management Foundation (11 tasks) - Core task CRUD functionality with authentication
4. Phase 4: Authentication Integration (9 tasks) - Complete auth flows and frontend integration

6. Phase 6: Security & Validation (10 tasks) - Security measures and validation
7. Phase 7: Quality Pass & Polish (9 tasks) - Final quality improvements

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], user story labels [US1-US5], and specific file paths. Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, with clear dependencies and execution order defined. Each task references relevant specifications and is independently verifiable.
