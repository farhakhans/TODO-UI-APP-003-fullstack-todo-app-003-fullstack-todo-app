# Agent Architecture Specification

## PROMPT_TEXT
$ARGUMENTS

Phase: Phase II – Full-Stack Web Application
Scope: Agent Architecture Explanation (Pre-Login Only)

Objective:
Explain how the system is internally organized using AGENTS,
to demonstrate architectural intelligence BEFORE login.

Context:
This is a spec-driven, agentic full-stack system built using
Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.
Agents are conceptual responsibility boundaries, not code entities.

Create the following specification:

@specs/features/agents.md

The Agents specification MUST define these agents:

1. Authentication Agent
   - Responsibility: User identity and session trust
   - Input: Login/signup intent
   - Output: Verified user identity (JWT)

2. Task Management Agent
   - Responsibility: Task lifecycle handling
   - Input: User task actions
   - Output: User-scoped task state

3. Data Isolation Agent
   - Responsibility: Enforce per-user data boundaries
   - Input: Authenticated user context
   - Output: Filtered database access

4. API Gateway Agent
   - Responsibility: Request validation and routing
   - Input: HTTP requests with JWT
   - Output: Authorized backend execution

5. UI Orchestration Agent
   - Responsibility: Frontend state and flow control
   - Input: User interactions
   - Output: Consistent, responsive UI behavior

Constraints:
- Conceptual explanation only
- Frontend display only
- No backend logic
- No execution behavior
- No diagrams requiring external tools

Quality Bar:
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Judge-readable architecture
- Professional, system-level language
- No overlap with Skills spec

Do NOT:
- Mention CRUD details
- Add authentication logic
- Include code
- Assume future phases

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created comprehensive agent architecture specification document that defines the five core agents of the application in business-readable language. The specification includes:

1. A detailed spec.md file with user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria
2. A dedicated agents.md file that clearly describes each of the five required agents:
   - Authentication Agent
   - Task Management Agent
   - Data Isolation Agent
   - API Gateway Agent
   - UI Orchestration Agent

Each agent is described with its specific responsibility, inputs, and outputs as required. The specification is written in system-level, non-technical language suitable for business stakeholders and focuses on pre-login architectural understanding. All requirements from the original prompt have been satisfied.
