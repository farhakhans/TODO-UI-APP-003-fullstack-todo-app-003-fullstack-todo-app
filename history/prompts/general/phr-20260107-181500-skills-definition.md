## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created comprehensive skills specification document that defines the five core skills of the application in business-readable language. The specification includes:

1. A detailed spec.md file with user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria
2. A dedicated skills.md file that clearly describes each of the five required skills:
   - Task Management Skill
   - Multi-User Isolation Skill
   - Secure Authentication Skill
   - Responsive Web Experience Skill
   - Scalable Architecture Skill

The specification is written in high-level, non-technical language suitable for business stakeholders and focuses on pre-login user experience. All requirements from the original prompt have been satisfied.
